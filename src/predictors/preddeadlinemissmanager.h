*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This function is invoked when a prediction was missed and returns a
* new (bigger) prediction.
*
* POSTCONDITION:
* that should be imposed by a derived class is that
*   If  : elapsed        <  estimate  &&  ! is_cheater
*   Then: returned_value <= estimate
* Because there is _never_ a reason to believe a scheduler will violate
* the backfilling-rule which specifies that a job is killed once its
* estimate is reached. A cheater manager may know the actual runtime
* so there's no need to impose on it this postcondition.
*
* POSTCONDITION:
*   returned_value > elapsed
*
* PRECONDITION:
* This is implied from the first postcondition and from the constraint
* of 'miss_count' below (which says that once the elapsed time exceeds
* the original user estimate, a new count should be started).
*   If  : elapsed    == estimate
*   Then: miss_count == 0
*
* PRECONDITION:
*   If  : elapsed < estimate
*   Then: is_pre_manager
*   Else: is_post_manager
*
* job:
*   The id of the job which missed its deadline.
* elapsed:
*   The time a job is currently running.
* estimate:
*   The original user estimate of the job.
* miss_count:
*   How many times was the job's prediction deadline missed in the past.
 *   NOTE that this is a new count for pre/post managers i.e. the count
*   is reinitialized to zero when a predictor begins to use a post
*   managers.
