Nick's New Trace Format Specification

NNTF declaration line - required
Header Line - optional but strongly encouraged
JobID - starts from 1 in the file
WorkflowID - 0 for no workflow, integer for a workflowID
PreceedingJobs - 0 for no preceeding jobs, integer JobID's otherwise, always contained in a []
Workflow Status - 0 for no workflow, 1 for begin, 2 for continue, 3 for end
User - string 
Number of Nodes required - int
IO fraction - float - 0 < X < 1
Arrival time - integer t >= 0
Wait time - integer t >= 0
Run time - integer t >= 0
Requested time - integer t >= 0, t >= run time

Everything with a # as first char is ignored
JobID, WorkflowID - internally will be renumbered so no need to be monotonic or continuous, just unique
